# RubyDungSharp
Attempted port of the first public minecraft build (i know of, aka rubydung) ported from decompiled java src to c#!

8/30/24 - ermm this is shit, just ported code and there's only a blue sky or fog thing idfk

This is in no way affiliated with mojang or similar, this is a port of pre-existing code.
Although this is original 'code' some are literally just copy + paste's from the og shit with some stuff modified to fit into c#.

Thanks for reading!!
